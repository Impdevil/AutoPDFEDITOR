Reportlab maybe the best option to edit the title

thats going to be interesting to do


user inputs batch number
    create new batch folder
    user inputs year requested
        --r
        find current year
        get correct file
        work backwards from end page, 
        find page needed
        add from that page forward
        add first 6 pages
        edit page 2 with reportlab
    export to pdf to batch folder
